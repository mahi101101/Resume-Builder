# Resume-Builder

As placement season of most of the colleges is going to start, making Resume is a very hectic work for all the students. Also, many companies judge the candidature of a student just by his/her Resume. So, it is necessary for the student to think beyond the third dimension while making the Resume.

The goal of this project is to create a web application that will help students by automatically creating their resume based on the details entered by the user in the form. The resume will be available on the webpage, which can be printed and can also be accessed anytime by logging in through your credentials.
